# Coding-Challenge

I spent a total of 3 hours and 15 minutes coding this, from around 3:30 to 5:45 on 11/06/2024.
I began by setting up the greeting and compiling a list of words.
I then wrote the loop that queries the user for letters and then writes how many letters are correct or incorrect and the number of correct and incorrect guesses.
I then wrote the code that compares the length of the two lists of the correctly guessed letters and the letters of the word being guessed. If they are the same the the program writes a congratulatory message.
Finally I wrote an if statement that asks the user if they want to play again. If they input yes, the program picks a new word and repeats the process. I they input no, the program thanks them for playing and quits.
